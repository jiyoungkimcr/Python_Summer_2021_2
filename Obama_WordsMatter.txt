Don’t tell me words don’t matter. I have a dream -just words words. We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal -just words. We have nothing to fear but fear itself -just words, just speeches. It’s true that speeches don’t solve all problems, but what is also true is that if we can’t inspire our country to believe again, then it doesn’t matter how many policies and plans we have, and that is why I’m running for president of the United States of America, and that’s why we just won eight elections straight because the American people want to believe in change again. Don’t tell me words don’t matter!
